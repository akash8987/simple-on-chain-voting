# Simple On-Chain Voting

This repository provides a streamlined, professional implementation of a decentralized voting system. It is designed to be "flat" for easy navigation while maintaining industry-standard security practices for Solidity development.

### Features
* **Proposals:** Initialize the contract with a list of proposal names.
* **Secure Voting:** Each address can vote exactly once.
* **Transparency:** Real-time tallying of votes directly on the blockchain.
* **Beginner Friendly:** No complex folder structures; just copy, paste, and deploy.

### Quick Start
1.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
2.  Compile the contract: `npx hardhat compile`
3.  Deploy to a testnet or local node using `deploy.js`.
